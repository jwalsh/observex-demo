#+TITLE: Internal Developer Platform (IDP) Demo
#+AUTHOR: Platform Engineering Team

* Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive demo of an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) designed to streamline development processes, improve collaboration, and enhance productivity across multiple teams. The IDP incorporates modern architectural principles, engineering practices, and operational needs while fostering a conducive environment for tech culture and career development.

* Observability Demo
The IDP demo highlights the following observability aspects:

  + Comprehensive Monitoring: Implementation of monitoring tools to track system performance, latency, and errors.
  + Logging and Tracing: Integration of logging and tracing mechanisms to provide insights into system behavior and facilitate debugging.
  + Metrics and Alerting: Configuration of metrics and alerting systems to ensure proactive issue detection and notification.
  + Visualization: Utilization of visualization tools to provide a unified view of system performance and facilitate data-driven decision-making.
